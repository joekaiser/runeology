# Runeology
Runeology is a mod for Minecraft 1.12 that allows a player to create Runestones with magical properties. For example, you will be able to create a Runestone that will repel hostile mobs, or one that will automatically destroy any items within range.

## How it works
 The core of the mod centers around *K'na* which, when channeled, produces effects that often spill over into the physical world. Channeling K'na is a straight-forward, but potentially dangerous process.

#### Getting Started
K'na stems from life and you won't be able to channel K'na without it. Although any location will work, it has been noticed that some climates are better are others. Plains are OK, but a flower forest would be better. Desserts and Oceans could work, but might product limited results.
 
 Once you have your location you need to find a small pool of water, wait for darkness and and toss in a piece Lapis Lazuli ore along with an Enchanted book. Once those are in the water, an Incantation must be said.
